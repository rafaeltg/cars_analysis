# Cars dataset analysis

Given the car data set (['cars.csv'](./cars.csv), of which we are trying to predict the level of acceptance of the car, provide an initial analysis of dataset (e.g. interesting observations, obsolete attributes, whatever you might find).

Machine learning using python stack:
* Data preparation
* Validation
* Choosing an algorithm
* Parameterization
* Training and evaluation

## Requirements:
* Python 3 (developed and tested on version 3.6.3)
* pip3 (developed and tested on version 9.0.1)

## Running:
1) Install required python packages: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt -U`

2) Run the script: `python3 cars.py`

3) The resulting input data analysis will be stored in the directory `analysis`, and the performances reports in the directory `reports`.
